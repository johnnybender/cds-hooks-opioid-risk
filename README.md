# Description

This project was created during the [US/UK Data Analyst Exchange Program](https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2018/03/15/data-analyst-exchange-program-aims-to-share-data-management-and-analysis-lessons-learned-from-across-the-globe/). It is a [CDSHooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) server that can push recommendations to a CDSHooks compliant application using the CDSHook [`medication-prescribe`](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/medication-prescribe/). This was used to demonstrate how the results of a opioid risk stratification tool could be presented to providers at the point of care. Providers could use the information from the opioid risk stratification tool to identify patients at high-risk of opioid addiction, which could prompt providers to recommend addiction prevention / support programs.

# Usage
